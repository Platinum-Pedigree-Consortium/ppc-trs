### Images of high-quality recurrent tandem repeat (TR) *de novo* mutations (DNMs)

This directory contains two images of HQ recurrent tandem repeat DNMs (which can be found in **Table 1** of the manuscript. 
Each image illustrates PacBio HiFi read evidence for TR allele sizes in every member of the K1463 pedigree (G2 individuals in the top panel, G3 in the center, and G4 in the bottom two panels). 
In each panel, individuals are ordered such that the two parents are at the bottom of the panel.
Each point represents a single read -- its position on the Y axis reflects which individual it is derived from, and its position on the X axis reflects the number of insertions or deletion in the read with respect to the reference genome (a proxy for the length of the TR allele).
For example, an X-value of -54 means that a read may have contained 54 base pairs of deleted sequence with respect to the reference, or may have contained 12 base pairs of inserted sequence and 66 base pairs of deleted sequence.
Points are colored orange if they are derived from an individual with a candidate *de novo* allele, and blue otherwise.
